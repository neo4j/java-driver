# Neo4j Java Driver


A database driver for a new Neo4j remoting protocol. 

## Minimum viable snippet

Add the driver to your project:

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.neo4j.driver</groupId>
            <artifactId>neo4j-java-driver</artifactId>
            <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Connect to a Neo4j 3.0.0+ database

    Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver( "bolt://localhost" );

    Session session = driver.session();

    StatementResult rs = session.run("CREATE (n) RETURN n");

    session.close();

    driver.close();

# Building

## Java version

If you are running Java 8:

    mvn clean install

If you are running Java 7, you need to also provide an environment variable telling the tests where to find
Java 8, because Neo4j-the-database needs it to run.

    export NEO4J_JAVA=<path/to/java/home>
    mvn clean install

    # For instance
    export NEO4J_JAVA=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)

## Windows

If you are building on windows, you need to run install as admin so that Neo4j-the-database could be registered as a
windows service and then be started and stopped correctly using its powershell scripts for windows.
