/**
 * A general pool implementation, heavily inspired by Chris Vests "stormpot" pool, but without a background thread
 * managing allocation.
 * <p>
 * Some quick info to understand this pool:
 * <li>
 * The pool caches a reference for each thread who uses this pool to the resource that has ever been assigned to the
 * thread by the pool.
 * Next time when the same thread wants to value a resource from the pool again, if the cached resource happens to be
 * free, the same resource will be assigned directly to the thread to avoid searching from the global pool.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The pool will fail all incoming resource requests once all the resources in the pool has been consumed. But the
 * resource requesting thread could choose to wait for a while for a possible available resource.
 * </li>
 *
 * @param <T> A pool of T
