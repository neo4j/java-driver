/**
 * Provides a context of work for database interactions.
 * <p>
 * A <em>Session</em> hosts a series of {@linkplain Transaction transactions}
 * carried out against a database. Within the database, all statements are
 * carried out within a transaction. Within application code, however, it is
 * not always necessary to explicitly {@link #beginTransaction() begin a
 * transaction}. If a statement is {@link #run} directly against a {@link
 * Session}, the server will automatically <code>BEGIN</code> and
 * <code>COMMIT</code> that statement within its own transaction. This type
 * of transaction is known as an <em>autocommit transaction</em>.
 * <p>
 * Explicit transactions allow multiple statements to be committed as part of
 * a single atomic operation and can be rolled back if necessary. They can also
 * be used to ensure <em>causal consistency</em>, meaning that an application
 * can run a series of queries on different members of a cluster, while
 * ensuring that each query sees the state of graph at least as up-to-date as
 * the graph seen by the previous query. For more on causal consistency, see
 * the Neo4j clustering manual.
 * <p>
 * Typically, a session will acquire a TCP connection to execute query or
 * transaction. Such a connection will be acquired from a connection pool
 * and released back there when query result is consumed or transaction is
 * committed or rolled back. One connection can therefore be adopted by many
 * sessions, although by only one at a time. Application code should never need
 * to deal directly with connection management.
 * <p>
 * A session inherits its destination address and permissions from its
 * underlying connection. This means that for a single query/transaction one
 * session may only ever target one machine within a cluster and does not
 * support re-authentication. To achieve otherwise requires creation of a
 * separate session.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, multiple sessions should be used when working with concurrency;
 * session implementations are not thread safe.
 *
 * @since 1.0 (Removed async API to {@link AsyncSession} in 2.0)
